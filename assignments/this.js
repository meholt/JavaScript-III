/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Window Binding: When the value of `this` keyword is that of the window
* 2. Implicit Binding: This is used for objects and the value of the `this` keyword
    is dependent upon the object in which it is called/used in.
* 3. Explicit Binding: This is used for functions and there are three different methods that could be used w/ the `this` keyword:
    .call, .apply, and .bind.
* 4. New Binding: This is a constructor function and is used to create a new object. When this is done, the value of `this` keyword 
    is that of the new object that the constructor function created.
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
